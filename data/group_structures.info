LANL group structures were obtained from the Data Team web site.
The indexing starts at 0; in normal parlance, the highest energy group
is group 1. The index is not used so this does not cause problems.

Group structures for 618, 250, 133, 70, and 30 were obtained from
https://xweb.lanl.gov/projects/data/nuclear/ndi_data/transport/group_structs/lanl_hifi.html

Group structures for 21, 16, 14, 13, 12, and 10 were obtained from
https://xweb.lanl.gov/projects/data/nuclear/ndi_data/transport/group_structs/lanl_legacy.html

Group structures for 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, and 1 were obtained from
https://xweb.lanl.gov/projects/data/nuclear/ndi_data/transport/group_structs/lanl_legacy_sm.html

The Kynea3 group structure was obtained from the bxslib file and written
in the same format and units as the LANL files.
